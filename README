VERSION
-------
0.6.1 (2012-03-02)

Currently tested under: Mac OSX 10.7.3, FreeBSD 8.2, GNU/Linux (Gentoo-2.6.32), Debian GNU/Linux

-----------
DESCRIPTION
-----------
	
	tfcb_log watches an inbox folder for incoming plain text files. if you put some content in there the files will be grabbed and enveloped to a date-sorted blog post structure. for each day a folder will created and symlinked to './latest' dir. an index.html and rss.xml output will saved in ./out 

------------
INSTALLATION
------------

	1) Run src/make all
			- the entire sourcecode gets compiled. afterwards the 'bin/make init' will automatically trigger the initialization process, which organizes the needed folder structure. in addition to that, a "Hello, World!" blog post will be generated with the actual date. 
			- after completion you will be asked to activate the watched inbox. do so to get the live thing running.

	NOTE:
		tfcb_log is going to create the following folder structure:
		
		./arch		- backup folder
		./inbox		- watched folder.
		./posts		- posts archive. (automatically handled)
		./log			- logs
		./out			- output folder for index.html / rss.xml
		./latest 	- symlink to -> ./posts/__newest_folder__

 	NOTE:
		In order to install the man page for tfcb_log, please cp the 'tfcb_log.1' file within the src directory to into '/usr/local/share/man/man1/' by yourself."
